# Filo - You don't stay un-notified.

## Overview
A app that renders agenda and assignments management services for students. This is done by a student set administrators posting/publishing agenda/assignments and every students concerned are notified (instantly).

## Why Filo?
To better understand why, we should look into the problem first.

### What was the problem?
The common and present means of communication on campus is by Whatsapp, which is very nice in itself, as groups are created for student's with mutual interest (probably same faculty, or department) and it aids communication easily and conviniently, but the issue now is with it effectiveness. Important information are sent into the group chats, but they tend to get lost as other group participants drop massages (which in most cases, are not actually useful) making the importatnt messages lost and mostly difficult to retrieve.

The other problem (which is not really much of a problem to many) is that, information is sent generally, which implies that, a student tend to get some information that doesn't concern him/her. Yes, there are attempts to resolve that, but trying to resolve it still ends in the first problem stated.

### The proposed solution.
Seeing that this could be very costly (in many cases), Filo is introduced to take care of that. Filo basically serves as a mobile notifier and manager for what is most important to students on campus (which is of course, our assignments and agendas for each day i.e lectures). Filo brings the information that concerns you to you, and keeps you notified.
